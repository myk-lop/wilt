# <time>: The (Date) Time element

The `<time>` HTML element represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

It may represent one of the following:
- A time on a 24-hour clock.
- A precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).
- A valid time duration.
