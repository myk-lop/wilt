# Hiding your personal email on your Github activity

If you want to hide your personal email from your Github activity: 
- go to your account settings;
- make sure your setting **Keep my email addresses private.** is selected;
- find your **noreply** email address (it might have different format depending on when you've joined Github);
- set that email address locally for your `git config` locally or globally.
