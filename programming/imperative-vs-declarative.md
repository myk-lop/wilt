# Imperative vs Declarative Programming

Imperative programming is **how** you do something, and declarative programming is more like **what** you do.

#### Example:

```
IMPERATIVE (HOW)
I see that table located under the Gone Fishinâ€™ sign is empty. My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.

DECLARATIVE (WHAT)
Table for two, please.
```
